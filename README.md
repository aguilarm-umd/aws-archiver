# aws-archiver

Command-line preservation archiving tool for S3

## Purpose

The aws-archiver tool is intended to facilitate deposit of assets to Amazon S3
storage while ensuring end-to-end asset fixity and the creation of auditable
deposit records.

## Installation

To install the tool for system-wide access, the recommended method is via pip:

```bash
$ git clone https://www.github.com/umd-lib/aws-archiver
$ cd aws-archiver && pip install -e .
```

## Usage

To see the list of available subcommands, run:

```bash
$ archiver --help
```

For help with a particular subcommand, run:

```bash
$ archiver <SUBCOMMAND> --help
```

where \<SUBCOMMAND> is the name of the subcommand. For example, for the
"deposit" subcommand:

```bash
$ archiver deposit --help
```

## "deposit" subcommand

```bash
Usage: archiver deposit [-h] -b BUCKET [-c CHUNK] [-l LOGS] [-n NAME] [-p PROFILE] [-r ROOT] [-s STORAGE] [-t THREADS] (-m MAPFILE | -a ASSET) [--dry-run]

Deposit a batch of resources to S3

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -b BUCKET, --bucket BUCKET
                        S3 bucket to deposit files into
  -c CHUNK, --chunk CHUNK
                        Chunk size for multipart uploads
  -l LOGS, --logs LOGS  Location to store log files
  -n NAME, --name NAME  Batch identifier or name
  -p PROFILE, --profile PROFILE
                        AWS authorization profile
  -r ROOT, --root ROOT  Root dir of files being archived
  -s STORAGE, --storage STORAGE
                        S3 storage class
  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS
                        Maximum number of concurrent threads
  -m MAPFILE, --mapfile MAPFILE
                        Archive assets in inventory file
  -a ASSET, --asset ASSET
                        Archive a single asset
  --dry-run             Perform a "dry run" without actually contacting AWS.
  ```

The "deposit" subcommand is used to deposit either a single asset (using the
"-a/--asset" argument) or multiple assets in a single batch (using the
"-m/--mapfile" argument).

For historical reasons, a "dep" alias is provided for the "deposit" subcommand.

### Batch manifest file

The "--mapfile" argument uses files in one of three different batch manifest
formats:

* md5sum manifest files
* patsy-db manifest files
* inventory manifest files

#### md5sum manifest files

A text file listing one asset per line, in the form
```<md5 hash> <whitespace> <absolute local path>```. This is the same line
format as the output of the Unix ```md5sum``` utility.  As a convenience, a
script to generate the latter from a directory of files is included in this
repository's ```bin``` directory.

To create a batch manifest with the included script, do:

```bash
$ ./bin/make_mapfile.sh path/to/asset/dir mapfile.txt
```

#### patsy-db manifest files

A CSV file listing one asset per line, in the form

```csv
<md5 hash>,<absolute local path>,<relative path>
```

See the "patsy-db" documentation for information about creating the manifest
file.

#### inventory manifest files

A CSV file listing one asset per line, as generated by the "inventory" command
of the "preserve" tool.

See the "preserve" documentation (<https://github.com/umd-lib/preserve>) for
more information about creating the manifest file.

**Note:** The "BATCH" field in the first row of the manifest file will be used
as the "name", overriding any "name" argument given on the command-line.

### AWS credentials

AWS credentials are required for making deposits. This tool uses the boto3
library to manage authorization using AWS authentication profiles. These
profiles are stored in ```~/.aws/credentials```. To choose a profile to use
with a batch, use the ```-p PROFILE``` option. If left unspecified, the tool
will default to the default profile. The chosen profile must have write
permission for the bucket specified in the ```-b BUCKET``` option.

### Default option values

The following arguments listed above as "optional" are necessary for the deposit
and use default values if not specified:

| option            | default       |
|-------------------|---------------|
| '-c', '--chunk'   | '4GB'         |
| '-l', '--logs'    | 'logs'        |
| '-n', '--name'    | 'test_batch'  |
| '-p', '--profile' | 'default'     |
| '-r', '--root'    | '.'           |
| '-s', '--storage' | 'DEEP_ARCHIVE'|
| '-t', '--threads' | 10            |

## "batch-deposit" subcommand

```text
usage: archiver batch-deposit [-h] -f BATCHES_FILE [-p PROFILE]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f BATCHES_FILE, --batches-file BATCHES_FILE
                        YAML file containing the paths to the manifests of individual batches.
  -p PROFILE, --profile PROFILE
                        AWS authorization profile
```

Enables depositing multiple batches specified in a YAML manifest.

## Restoring from AWS Deep Glacier

You can restore files from AWS Deep Glacier using the scripts [bin/requestfilesfromdeepglacier.sh](bin/requestfilesfromdeepglacier.sh) and [bin/copyfromawstolocal.sh](bin/copyfromawstolocal.sh).

1. Install the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/). One option for installation is `brew install awscli`.

2. Configure your region and credentials following the instructions in the AWS CLI Reference, [General Options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/topic/config-vars.html?highlight=credentials#general-options) and [Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/topic/config-vars.html?highlight=credentials#credentials).

3. Create a CSV input file with the list of files to restore, including the 3 columns bucketname, filelocation, fileserverlocation, without a header row.  The scripts will prompt for the name of the input file. Example file contents:

  ```csv
  libdc-archivebucket-foobarxyz,Archive092/scpa-062057-0018.tif,./restore_directory
  ```

4. Request the restoration from Deep Glacier to an S3 bucket using `bin/requestfilesfromdeepglacier.sh`. The restoration may take up to 48 hours to complete.

5. Copy the file from the S3 bucket to the local file system using `bin/copyfromawstolocal.sh`.

## Conformance Tests

Manual tests to verify application conformanance to actual AWS behavior are
specified in [docs/ConformanceTests.md](docs/ConformanceTests.md).
